## About

I love to make things and learn a lot while doing it. I am available for Chess and Code all time. I spend most of time staring at a monitor. When I get tired of it, I play Table Tennis or try gaining weight at Gym. :D

I often juggle between various technologies. Mostly, I fiddle with technologies that I am not familiar with. When I beat my laziness, I blog about it too. I am interested in <acronym title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym>. If you need help for your repository, please be in touch.

    I write what I think and it has nothing to do with my employer!
